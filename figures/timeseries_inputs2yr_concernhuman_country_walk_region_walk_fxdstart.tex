\caption{{\bf Predictive ability across input survey questions:} The table shows the coefficient of determination (Partial R$^2$) 
                    for regressions between responses to each combination of two questions that are asked in three or more years. 
                    Column 3 shows the coefficient of determination after removing country 
                  fixed effects. Column 4 shows the degrees of freedom in the regression, and column 5 shows the number of years for which we have 
                    data from both time series in some overlapping set of countries.}
